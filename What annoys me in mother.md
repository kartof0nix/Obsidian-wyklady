Yes she is caring alright. But also she is overworked - as a result of her carenesness and her heavy work. This results in her being highly frustrated and I then I can't really tell her how I feel.
And the biggest problem is, she won't take any help because so.
Like take right now as an example. We are on holiday. She said "okay now go ahead and sleep". And so being tired I did try to. But before I managed to fall asleep she just went ahead and sat down in the saloon me and my sister are sleeping in and just started working, in order not to wake up dad. And like... you either tell me that I shouldn't care to go sleep or go work somewhere else.
And no, even if she asks "why am I frustrated?", if I were to be honest she would just get mad at my like "you have to accept the talon as it is", "I have to work and ...". 
Mother, you made me the most angry I could ever be by making a combo of: 1) being still just the same tired 2) having wasted a lot of my time on doing LITERALLY NOTHING, not even sightseeing 3) having done nothing whilist being burries under errands
Like, just tell me "we'll be resting for a short time" next time or be more abiding by your words. But no, you're gonna fucking scrutinise me if I even dare say a word.

This just ... I hate family holiday... the only thing keeping me in shape is the vision of tomorrow's havenly acid... that should be fun enough to make up for some of the annoying things I go through here.

Aad so don't be shocked if I come back home one day being a girl and you'll have no idea I have had been taking estro for 2 years until. You're just difficult to talk to.
